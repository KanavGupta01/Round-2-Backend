Get Your Dopamine Hit and Start Coding!!


Create a backend app listening at port 1337.
Your first task is to create an endpoint for uploading file. (/uploadFile)
/uploadFile takes file data inside post body and saves the file inside root directory or “uploads” folder.

Processing:

On uploading, make 5 chunks of the file.
Process all the chunks with two processes.
First process should append character “R” at begining of every line of the chunk.
Second process should append character “2” at the begining of every line of the chunk.
Both processes are synchronous. Second process runs after first process’s completion.
After all the processing is done. Save the new file.
No authentication, no signing up nothing
Just create a single endpoint and do all this server processing.

Estimated Time: 45 mins
